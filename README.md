# Atlas

</div>

Atlas is a personal, local-first desktop application I built for myself.

It combines the tools I regularly use — system monitoring, gaming utilities,
media tools, and server access — into a single Tauri-based app.

This project evolves as my needs change. It is not intended to be a general-
purpose product.

## Tech
- React + Vite (frontend)
- Tauri (Rust backend)
- Python workers for utilities and ML
